# Library Management System

This project is an SQL-based Library Management System developed to understand how real-world databases are designed and managed.
The system stores and organizes data related to books, authors, library branches, borrowers, and book loans in a structured way.
Proper table relationships are created using primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity and consistency.
Database normalization is applied to avoid data duplication and improve efficiency.
SQL queries using joins, aggregate functions, and conditions are written to extract meaningful information.
The project reflects practical experience in SQL fundamentals and real-life data handling.

# Objectives of the Project

To design and implement a structured relational database for a library management system
To define tables with appropriate primary keys and foreign key constraints ensuring data integrity
To model real-world library operations by establishing relationships between books, branches, borrowers, and transactions
To perform SQL-based data analysis using joins, aggregations, and filtering techniques
To extract meaningful insights that support decision-making and operational efficiency

# Schema Explanation

The database consists of seven interconnected tables
Each table represents a real-world entity such as books, publishers, loans,borrowers and author
Relationships are maintained using foreign keys to ensure data consistency
The Book Loans table acts as a transaction table connecting books, borrowers, and branches
The schema supports efficient data storage and retrieval


# Final Business Insights and Recommendations

## Key Insights

Loan activity varies across library branches, indicating differences in user demand and branch utilization
A small group of borrowers is responsible for a higher number of book loans, showing repeat borrowing behavior
Books by popular authors consistently attract demand across multiple branches

## Recommendations

Increase the number of copies for high-demand books to reduce waiting time and improve user satisfaction
Track frequent borrowers to ensure fair and balanced access to library resources
Optimize inventory distribution by reallocating books based on branch-wise demand patterns

# Conclusion

Successfully designed and implemented a robust relational database for a library management system
Effectively utilized SQL queries to answer real-world business and operational questions
Gained strong understanding of database schema design, relationships, and constraints
Demonstrated the practical application of SQL in analyzing and managing real-world data scenarios
